## Darren Redmond's Lego Set Explorer  

This Shiny App tracks Darren Redmond's lego collection and combines the lego sample app's charts with brickset's native charts to allow searching and visulizating of LEGO Sets information from his first set bought to his most current.

The total number of set records is 402 and counting in 18 different themes, the main one being Star Wars.

The dataset is sets owned by Darren Redmond tracked on [Brickset.com](http://brickset.com/), and it contains the basic information of each set (set id, year, number of pieces, theme, set name, sub theme, price paid, number of mini figures).  

In this version - there are no graphs for the number of mini-figures.
